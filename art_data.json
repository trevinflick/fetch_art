    "description": "Unlike many American artists, Marsden Hartley was more drawn to German Expressionism than to French modernism. This painting, made in Berlin, possesses an energy that evokes both the vibrancy of modern Berlin and movements of music. Like the painter Vasily Kandinsky, Hartley sought to make his work more like music, which he admired for its potential to be purely spiritual and separate from material reality.",
