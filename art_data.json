    "description": "This work was originally part of a large triptych commissioned for the Charterhouse of Champol, a monastery outside Dijon. Even separated from its context within the altarpiece, however, the painting remains a powerfully expressive work. Christ\u2019s tensed hands and feet and earthy features are realistically observed, while the curving contour of his torso and the folds of his loincloth reflect a more courtly ideal.",
