    "description": "The growing relationship between armor and costume in the 16th century is indicated in the center band of this armor. Delicately incised and etched, with scalloped edge, it mimics the embroidered front closing of a contemporary male doublet (a close-fitted bodice). The particularly fine decoration of etched floral arabesques suggests the workmanship of the Augsburg armory, perhaps of J\u00f6rg T. Sorg.",
