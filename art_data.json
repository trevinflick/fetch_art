    "description": "Although Jo Baer\u2019s work of the 1960s relied on the simple geometric forms and serial imagery used by many Minimal and Conceptual artists, her practice was distinguished by her unwavering commitment to the medium of paint on canvas. From 1963 to 1975, she limited her imagery to bands of black combined with colors at the edges of the canvas as a means of emphasizing the essential, object-like qualities of painting.",
