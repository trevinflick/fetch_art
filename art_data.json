    "description": "Edvard Munch\u2019s life and art have come to epitomize modern notions of anxiety. Created the same year as his renowned <em>The Scream</em>, this painting depicts a young girl in her nightgown gazing out at the city from her darkened room. The steep angle of the floor and the deep shadows that obliterate almost everything in the room create an unsettling and enigmatic scene.",
