    "description": "Kerry James Marshall describes this work as \u201cthe shape of Africa reconfigured as a cubist sculpture.\u201d The attached laminated images and texts refer to figures within the black freedom movement in America as well as to Egyptian iconographies championed by African Americans in the 1970s. Marshall adds new elements each time the sculpture goes on view, treating it as a living and continually evolving work.",
