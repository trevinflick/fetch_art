    "description": "Alberto Giacometti began making his distinctively elongated bronze sculptures in Paris in the late 1940s. His works struck a powerful chord with the Existentialist writer Jean-Paul Sartre, who saw the isolated figures as a visualization of his own ideas about the loneliness and ultimate absurdity of the human condition at the end of World War II. Giacometti insisted that he was simply attempting to convey his own experience of looking at people.",
