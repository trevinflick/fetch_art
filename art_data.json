    "description": "This vibrantly painted stela commemorates the husband and wife Amenemhat and Hemet in the youthful state they intended to inhabit for eternity. The table piled with food ensures their eternal nourishment and also reflects the practice of family and community members honoring their dead. A stela like this would have been placed in a public location where visitors could come to recite the inscriptions aloud.",
