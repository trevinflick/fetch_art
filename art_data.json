    "description": "While we might think of portraits as capturing an individual\u2019s likeness, for the nonroyal Egyptians, it was the addition of a name in hieroglyphs that identified them; their facial features and clothing were determined not by physical likeness but by contemporary styles. The inscriptions on the front and back of this statue distinguish it as a representation of a man named Shebenhor.",
