    "description": "Born in Turkish Armenia, Arshile Gorky immigrated to the United States in the 1920s and became an influential member of the New York art scene. During 1944\u201347 he created his most important work in a kind of stream of consciousness or \u201cautomatic\u201d manner of painting. This work reflects Gorky's indebtedness to the lyrical Surrealism of Joan Mir\u00f3, but the sketchy handling of paint, translucent color, and tumbling pile of shapes are distinctly Gorky.",
