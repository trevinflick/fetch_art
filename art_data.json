    "description": "This painting by El Greco depicts Saint Martin, a popular saint in the 1600s when the Catholic Church was promoting acts of charity, like Martin giving his cloak to a beggar, as necessary for salvation. The composition includes other elements that would have resonated with El Greco's local audience: Saint Martin wears fashionable armor, and the walls of Toledo are visible in the distant background.",
