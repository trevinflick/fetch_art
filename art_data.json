    "description": "<em>The Key</em> marks a crucial moment in Pollock's artistic evolution, prefiguring many elements that would be integral in his celebrated drip paintings, which debuted the next year. This work was created on the floor and worked on from all sides. Although there is a suggestion of landscape, the painting process was the primary subject. The resulting abstraction is expressive and gestural, conveying the power of spontaneous action and chance effects.",
