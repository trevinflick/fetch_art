    "description": "Cast in solid copper, this statuette is thought to represent a supernatural being that served as an intermediary between the physical world and the spiritual realm. The muscular, bearded figure wears a headdress of goat horns and ears, a raptor skin over his shoulders, a cylindrical belt around his waist, and boots with curved toes. His eyes are inlaid with shell or stone; the now-missing pupils were probably made from a contrasting material.",
