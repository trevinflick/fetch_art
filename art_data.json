    "description": "Cycladic sculpture is characterized by the abstract treatment of the human form. The vast majority of Cycladic white marble statuettes depict pregnant females, suggesting an association with fertility or regenerative forces. Although they are admired today for their stark simplicity, these statuettes once had hair, eyes, jewelry, or other ornaments added in red, blue, and black pigment, which has since faded.",
