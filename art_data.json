    "description": "Fascinated by contrasts in scale, O\u2019Keeffe often juxtaposed enlarged still-life elements with distant landscapes. Here, vibrant blossoms are magnified against the dry, steep hills surrounding her New Mexico home. She admired the land's colors, later equating them with paints: \u201cAll the earth colors of the painter\u2019s palette are out there.... The light Naples yellow through the ochers\u2014orange and red and purple earth\u2014even the soft earth greens.\"",
