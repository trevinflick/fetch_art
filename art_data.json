    "description": "Jean Arp was a leader in the development of the organic, curving language of biomorphism, which infused Surrealism with forms alluding to growth and the natural world. In the early 1930s, Arp began to translate his abstract style into three-dimensional sculptures, emphasizing the natural processes of metamorphosis in art.",
