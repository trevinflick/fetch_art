    "description": "One of Surrealism\u2019s most important patrons, Edward James was a willing collaborator whose sense of play initiated commissions for his homes from such artists as Ren\u00e9 Magritte and Salvador Dal\u00ed. James invited Magritte to paint three canvases for his London home. Magritte made this work during his stay there in 1937, reworking the motif of an earlier horizontal painting into a vertical format to fit its destined location in James\u2019s ballroom.",
