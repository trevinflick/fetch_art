    "description": "Chinese ceramic figures made for burial often evoke the fashions and recreational activities of their aristocratic owners. This figure sensitively captures a woman gently guiding her horse. Her weight, costume, and hairstyle reflect early-to-mid-eighth-century ideals of feminine beauty. Stylistically, the woman closely resembles figures recently unearthed from the tombs of high-status individuals that are datable to about 740.",
