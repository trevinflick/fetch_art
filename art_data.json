    "description": "Experimental ceramist Toshiko Takaezu grounded her work in both her Japanese heritage and midcentury modern abstraction. Her distinctive vessel-like sculptures range from small spheres to over six-feet-tall elongated forms; some have a small opening at the top, and others do not, rejecting utilitarian function. Takaezu layered multiple glazes in a variety of colors and intensities to make her sculptures \u201ccome alive.\u201d",
