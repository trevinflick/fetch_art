    "description": "Eve owes its genesis to <em>The Gates of Hell</em>, Rodin's commission from the French government in 1880, whose sculptural doors led Rodin back to the art of Lorenzo Ghiberti and Michelangelo. Eve recalls Michelangelo\u2019s panels from the Sistine Chapel Ceiling and Masaccio\u2019s Expulsion from the Garden of Eden. Its naturalism shocked critics when it was first exhibited, since Eve seemed to them more like a flesh-and-blood woman than an idealized creation.",
