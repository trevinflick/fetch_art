    "description": "Yayoi Kusama began making art as a child as a form of escape and therapy. An early hallucination of repeated, encompassing dots and colors has continued to influence her art, appearing in her performances, paintings, sculptures, and environments throughout her career. In 1957 Kusama moved from Japan to New York and began her \u201cinfinity net\u201d paintings, filling canvases with minimal, meditative compositions of net-like patterns.",
