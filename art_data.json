    "description": "Supplicants placed votive heads in temples to accompany requests and offerings of thanks to the gods. Such heads, depicting men and women, were made by artisans using molds. On finer examples, such as this head, a pointed tool was used to refine elements of the face and hair before the object was fired in the kiln. Earrings once hung from holes in the ears, and traces of pigment suggest that the hair was originally painted bright red.",
