    "description": "The painting's fields of unmodulated black, blue, and red reflect Henri Matisse's growing interest in abstraction and a formal effect he termed \u201cballast,\u201d a synonym for stability. Painted only months before France declared war on Germany, <em>Daisies</em> was seized by the Nazis as part of dealer Paul Rosenberg\u2019s collection. It was recovered by the US Army after the end of the war.",
