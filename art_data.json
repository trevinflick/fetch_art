    "description": "John Singer Sargent dedicated much effort to painting outdoors, especially after 1907, when he stepped away from more time-consuming portraiture. This canvas was painted on the shore of Lake Garda in Italy, where he traveled with friends and family in 1913. He skillfully manipulated thick and thin applications of pigment to evoke rugged rock, reflective waters, fishing boats, and silhouetted figures, producing an airy and dynamic composition",
