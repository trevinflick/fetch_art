    "description": "This work is one of a series of marionettes Alexandra Exter made in 1926 for an unrealized film. Her inventive figurines draw on revolutionary artistic developments of the 20th century, including mechanization, nontraditional art materials, assemblage, collage, and abstraction. Exter used glass for the robot\u2019s face to play on the faculty of sight, and she made an accordion of cardboard cubes for the chest to suggest the act of breathing.",
