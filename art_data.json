    "description": "Roni Horn's work is often inspired by natural elements, and <em>Deeps and Skies</em>, made from reheated and molded glass, evokes both water and sky. As she described, \u201cWhen you stand by any body of water, there\u2019s a whole history of reverie that clicks on . . . . water becomes a form\u2014of consciousness, of time . . . of anything I want it to be.\"",
