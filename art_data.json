    "description": "In the summer of 1940, Georgia O'Keeffe found an inspiring sight: \u201cThe places you can go on a horse here always astonish me . . . the most exciting was being on top of a ridge of red hills and seeing the blue flat topped mountains above them\u2014it was very good.\u201d She painted this work a month later, depicting bushes of small white flowers growing from the eroded gullies of the red badland, the blue mesa barely visible to the right.",
