    "description": "In 1891 Auguste Rodin was commissioned by a literary society to produce a posthumous monument to the French writer Honor\u00e9 de Balzac. Over the course of seven years, the sculptor created numerous studies, including this deliberately ungainly nude portrait. A departure from the idealized classical bodies typical of public statuary, this study stresses Balzac\u2019s vitality and candor through its bold modeling, imposing torso, and confident stance.",
