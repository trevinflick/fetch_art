    "description": "Peale was a prominent figure in the cultural and scientific life of Philadelphia in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Mrs. John Nicholson (Hannah Duncan) and John Nicholson, Jr. is a tender portrait of mother and child. The natural backdrop and sprig of flowers in the boy\u2019s hand signal a domestic bond. Mrs. Nicholson\u2019s uncorseted dress and freely coiffed hair (without a wig) likewise speak to the humanistic ideals of the Enlightenment.",
