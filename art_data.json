    "description": "This coin featuring the emperor Constantine I (reigned 306\u201337 CE) was minted soon after he became sole emperor. It depicts him with a youthful, clean-shaven face and a hairstyle of thick locks arranged over his forehead. These features deliberately evoked the appearance of earlier, celebrated emperors, including Augustus (reigned 27 BCE\u201314 CE) and Trajan (reigned 98\u2013117 CE), visually tying his reign to his esteemed predecessors\u2019.",
