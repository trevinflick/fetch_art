    "description": "Paul Cezanne set this idyllic view of bathers in a frame of foliage. He rendered the ground, water, trees, and sky with patches of hatching, conveying the energy he felt when painting. His primary concern, however, seems to have been striking a balance between the vigor of the bodies and the restfulness of the setting through individual poses and figure groupings.",
