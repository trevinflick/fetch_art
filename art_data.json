    "description": "Among the Qing emperors, the Yongzheng emperor particularly valued decorative objects and personally oversaw the imperial kilns, setting exacting standards. These thin cups are a testament to his precise tastes. Delicate cobalt blue floral medallions filled with translucent enamels showcase the <em>doucai</em> technique. Different from typical Qing porcelains, these were perhaps influenced by Japanese lacquers imported in the 16th and 17th centuries.",
