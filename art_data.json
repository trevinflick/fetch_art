    "description": "Gustave Courbet played a crucial role in the development of modern French Realism. Critics and the public, however, did not easily accept his large, naturalistic, and unsentimental depictions of commonplace, often rural subjects. They called him the \u201capostle of ugliness.\u201d This painting's subject, M\u00e8re Gr\u00e9goire, was inspired by the heroine of a popular song, the proprietor of a brothel, written in the 1820s.",
