    "description": "Among the first objects purchased for the museum's collection, this ancient Greek jar was originally used to mix water and wine. Painted in the red-figure style (so called because the figures remain the natural red of the clay), this vessel portrays the women followers of Dionysos, the Greek god of wine. Remarkably this millennia-old vase retains its original lid.",
