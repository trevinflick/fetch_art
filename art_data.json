    "description": "This Goryeo dynasty (918\u20131392) vase showcases the <em>sanggam</em> decorating technique. A time-consuming and complex process, it involves carving a motif, filling it with white and/or red clay (which turns black after firing), and finally applying the final bluish-green glaze. This vase depicts two ovoid-framed scenes: children playing in a bamboo garden and cranes flying through clouds, symbolizing a wish for fertility and longevity.",
