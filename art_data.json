    "description": "In this canvas, women of varying ages appear to go about daily life within a colorful, stylized outdoor environment. Like much of Gauguin's work, the composition combines observed detail with artistic fantasy to create a dreamlike scene that resists simple interpretation. Its deliberately provocative title enhances this effect, leaving us to wonder if the \u201cyou\u201d refers to someone in the painting or to the viewer.",
