    "description": "Georges Seurat made this painting as a preparatory work for his monumental <em>Bathers at Asni\u00e8res</em>, now in the National Gallery, London. It shows men and boys on the bank of the Seine River in the working-class Parisian suburb of Asni\u00e8res. The view presented here is just across the river from the leisure park Seurat immortalized in his best-known work, <em>A Sunday on La Grande Jatte\u20141884</em>.",
