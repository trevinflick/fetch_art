    "description": "In 1910 and 1911, Arthur Dove became the first American painter to experiment with pure abstraction, and by the 1920s he was developing a unique representational style that simplified elements and toyed with scale to capture the fundamental forms and forces of nature. Here, shimmering concentric circles of silver and blue radiate downward from a black sun, dwarfing its reflection in the water below.",
