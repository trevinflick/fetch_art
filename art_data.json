    "description": "Trained as an architect in Vienna and Berlin, Paul T. Frankl immigrated to New York in 1914 and began designing interiors and championing the skyscraper as a source of a uniquely American modernist vision. The geometric form of this cabinet rests on a sharply molded base; the bottom cabinet is topped with compartments and shelves, whose unadorned surfaces exemplify modernist design.",
