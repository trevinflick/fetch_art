    "description": "Like other foreign artists drawn to the ruins of antiquity, Claude Lorrain was fascinated with the Roman Empire. This painting of the ancient city of Delphi (in what is now Greece) presents a glowing Mediterranean atmosphere. Here, he evokes a serene, bucolic world akin to the poetic vision of the Roman writer Virgil, depicting the ruins restored to what Lorrain imagined was their original glory.",
