    "description": "This portrait depicts Antinous, the young lover of Emperor Hadrian (reigned 117\u201338). Recent scholarship indicates that this fragment once was part of an over-life-size bust of Antinous currently in the Palazzo Altemps in Rome. Though only a piece of a whole, one still can see Antinous's characteristic features\u2014an oval face, smooth complexion, almond-shaped eyes, full lips, and thick, wavy locks.",
