    "description": "The physical form of Felix Gonzalez-Torres's <em>\u201cUntitled\u201d (Portrait of Ross in L.A.)</em> can change with each display, but it always starts with 175 pounds of candy. This likely corresponds to the average body weight of an adult male, or perhaps the artist\u2019s partner Ross Laycock, who died of complications from AIDS in 1991. As visitors take candy, the weight changes, linking the interaction with loss.",
