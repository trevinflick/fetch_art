    "description": "Manet\u2019s trip to Spain in the fall of 1865 lasted about 10 days, though it had a profound impact on him. In a letter to his friend the poet Charles Baudelaire, he described a bullfight he attended in Madrid as \u201cone of the finest, most curious and most terrifying sights to be seen.\u201d He made quick sketches there that informed several later canvases, including this one.",
