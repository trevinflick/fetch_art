    "description": "Matta referred to this imaginative landscape\u2014his best-known painting\u2014as an \u201cinscape.\u201d He painted it in honor of the poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, who was assassinated in 1936, and used the technique of psychic automatism, developed by the Surrealists, to create the composition's turbulent forms. Exhibited in New York City, the mural-size canvas influenced a new generation of American artists: the Abstract Expressionists.",
