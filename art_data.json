    "description": "In Zulu culture of the 19th and early 20th centuries, neck rests signaled prestige and were used to protect the stylish and complex hairstyles of men and women during sleep. Beyond their practical use, these wooden neck rests provide connection to the spiritual realm. Though highly abstracted, this example evokes a bull, which is a source of wealth and a means of ancestral communication.",
