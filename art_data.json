    "description": "The victory of the Olympic gods over the ancient race of giants was a perfect subject for Wtewael to showcase exaggerated athletic poses and striking contrasts of space and light. Painted on copper, this small work almost appears gem-like. Wtewael's self-conscious display of skills was a hallmark of the international style known as Mannerism, which was fashionable in Holland around 1600.",
