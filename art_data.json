    "description": "When Iznik pottery production began in the late 15th century, its style and colors were influenced by Chinese porcelain. By the late 16th century, when this dish was made, Iznik potters had developed their own distinctive style of colorful floral and abstract motifs. Here, atop a fish-scale motif, we see two opposing leaves in the saz (reed) style, referring to the reed pen used by Persian and Turkish artists to create black-ink drawings.",
