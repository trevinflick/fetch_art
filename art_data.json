    "description": "Saint Michael, one of the seven archangels in the Old Testament, led the heavenly host against God\u2019s enemies in the book of Revelation. This 15th-century wood sculpture represents Michael\u2019s battle against Satan. The image would have been associated with the hope of salvation, as Saint Michael was often depicted weighing the souls of the blessed and the damned during the Last Judgment.",
