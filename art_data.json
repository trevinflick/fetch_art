    "description": "Katharina Fritsch makes meticulous reproductions of everyday objects, rendering them unfamiliar through extreme shifts in scale and bold color choices, both alluring and repellent. Indeed, saturated and nonreflective coats of color lend her sculptures a strong sense of otherworldliness. The marvelously pink <em>Woman with Dog</em> is clearly scaled up\u2014enormously so\u2014from a small figurine made of shells, as one might find in a seaside souvenir shop.",
