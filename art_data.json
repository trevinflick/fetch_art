    "description": "In the 1930s, the Surrealist movement grew beyond its avant-garde origins and extended into the mainstream realms of theater and design. Mir\u00f3 embraced this as an opportunity for new creative possibilities. This painting is one of four cartoons for tapestries commissioned in 1933 by the French art collector and gallery director Marie Cuttoli. Two designs, including this one, were made into tapestries at the famous French Aubusson tapestry works.",
