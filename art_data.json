    "description": "This work is the first fully realized example of Georges Braque\u2019s early Cubist style. He described the English Channel coast in severe geometries and a sober palette, reduced in range and intensity to pale shades of color. His compressed treatment of space and use of a shifting perspective seem to propel the two sailboats forward to the front edges of the picture.",
