    "description": "If not for the fog, Monet remarked, \u201cLondon wouldn't be a beautiful city. It\u2019s the fog that gives it its magnificent breadth.\u201d While working on his London Series, Monet painted Waterloo Bridge early in the morning and moved on to Charing Cross Bridge at midday. He finished his London works in his Giverny studio, working until he was satisfied with them as an ensemble.",
