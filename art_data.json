    "description": "Though vessels like this were designed to hold water for ritual bathing before marriage, they could also be placed at the tombs of young women who did not live to a marriageable age. This example likely served such a purpose, as it depicts a woman within a <em>naiskos</em>, a temple-like structure marking a family gravesite, in addition to images of a bride preparing herself for her wedding day with the help of female friends and family.",
