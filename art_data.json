    "description": "For his largest and best-known painting, Georges Seurat depicted Parisians enjoying all sorts of leisurely activities\u2014strolling, lounging, sailing, and fishing\u2014in the park called La Grande Jatte on the River Seine. He used an innovative technique called Pointillism that was inspired by optical and color theory, applying tiny dabs of different colored paint that viewers would see as a single, and Seurat believed, more brilliant hue.",
