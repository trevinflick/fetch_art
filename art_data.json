    "description": "This elaborate piece by Yoon Kwang-cho is a modern interpretation of buncheong ware, blue-grayish stoneware with white-slip decoration originally made during the early Joseon dynasty (1392\u20131910). Kwang-cho abandoned the traditional potter's wheel and instead created his irregular sculptural form by hand, inscribing it with a short Buddhist text known as the Heart Sutra as a manifestation of his meditation.",
