    "description": "In this composition, Alice Rahon represented herself with a palette in hand, standing atop a series of ascending switchbacks lined with animals, human figures, mountains, and trees. The work\u2019s shimmering surface is composed of materials sourced from the natural environment, including sand and volcanic ash. One of just two self-portraits the artist created, the work suggests movement, travel, and her journey to becoming a painter.",
