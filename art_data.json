    "description": "In the 1860s, Julie Hart Beers launched a successful career as an artist, supporting herself and her family through her artwork, teaching, and leading sketching excursions for groups of women throughout New England and the Adirondack Mountains. Her detailed, atmospheric landscapes, captured with swift brushwork, both earned her critical acclaim and contributed to the 19th-century landscape painting movement known as the Hudson River School.",
