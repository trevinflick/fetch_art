    "description": "Kara Walker often uses silhouettes, which were particularly popular with \"proper ladies\" during the years leading up to the Civil War, but subverts the tradition by grafting her contemporary perspective onto it. Here, she draws a parallel between an enslaved girl with the keys to the chicken's coop (as well as the chicken's head) in her hands and her masters holding her freedom in theirs.",
