    "description": "Belle-\u00cele, a small island off the southern shore of Brittany, was known for its dramatic cliffs, rock formations, and grottoes. As he often did, Monet misjudged the time he would need to explore and capture the beauty of the place, which he variously called \u201clugubrious,\u201d \u201cterrifying,\u201d and \u201cvery beautiful.\u201d He came for two weeks and stayed for more than two months.",
