    "description": "Narcissa Niblack Thorne must have imagined the occupants of this miniature Victorian drawing room to be loyal English subjects, as it abounds with images of Queen Victoria and her husband, Albert. The room's many ornate objects were constructed using a mix of faux and genuine materials: the candelabras are painted to look like gold, whereas the lamps flanking the doorway are made from real ivory.",
