    "description": "Designed to contain offerings of meat in rituals, this vessel was cast with a lengthy inscription on its interior commemorating a solemn ceremony at the imperial court. Although the monsterlike masks on each leg display animal imagery common on older bronzes, the bands that encircle the bowl are more abstracted, marking a turning point in the art of early Chinese bronzes.",
