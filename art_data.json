    "description": "Iconic guardians of the Art Institute, this lion, along with its southern partner, has stood at the museum's Michigan Avenue entrance since 1894. Modeled by Edward Kemeys, a self-taught artist and the nation\u2019s first great animalier (sculptor of animals), the pair were cast in Chicago and together weigh over four tons. Kemeys referred to the northern lion as \u201con the prowl,\u201d while the southern one assumes \u201can attitude of defiance.\u201d",
