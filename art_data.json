    "description": "When making an artwork, Cezanne often significantly altered his original design. This canvas was cut from a larger painting, retaining remnants of the other composition. In the lower-left corner, a series of blue lines might be legs of a seated figure; the body may have continued on another part of the canvas. These lines on top of the background foliage, indicate that he added a second figure after completing the first, before changing his mind.",
