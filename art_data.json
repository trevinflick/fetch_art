    "description": "Mottled light passing through a floor-to-ceiling window of handmade glass illuminates the many intriguing details Narcissa Niblack Thorne included in this miniature room. Above the ornately carved paneling at the back is a door, the entrance for troupes of musicians who might have provided entertainment during a banquet. The portraits and armor that flank the fireplace convey Thorne\u2019s romantic vision of a noble household.",
