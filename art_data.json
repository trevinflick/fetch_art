    "description": "This vase epitomizes the achievements of the royal porcelain factory at S\u00e8vres during the Napoleonic period. Commissioned by Napoleon in 1805 but produced only in 1813, this vase was still at the factory when Napoleon was exiled in 1814. It served as a diplomatic gift from his successor, King Louis XVIII, to Viscount Castlereagh, the British foreign secretary, and, later, the 2nd Marquess of Londonderry.",
