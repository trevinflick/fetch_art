    "description": "During the last decade of his life, John Henry Twachtman frequently painted views of the landscape surrounding his home in Greenwich, Connecticut. Almost square in format, this painting\u2019s harmonious composition exemplifies Twachtman\u2019s opinion that \u201cnever is nature more lovely than when it is snowing.\u201d He enjoyed depicting the beauty of the frozen terrain, believing that it was conducive to contemplation and regeneration.",
