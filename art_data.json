    "description": "This portrait was once part of a diptych. The sitter\u2014identifiable through his coat of arms, personal motto, and initials on the panel's back\u2014is Jean Gros, an administrator to the future duke of Burgundy. His prayerful gaze was originally directed at the other panel depicting Mary and the infant Jesus. Rogier van der Weyden created similar diptychs for the Burgundian court's highest level of patrons.",
