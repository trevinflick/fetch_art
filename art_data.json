    "description": "Lachaise modeled this work on Isabel Dutaud Nagle, whom he married in 1917. Although the sculpture evokes her individual appearance, its voluptuous torso recalls those of ancient fertility goddesses. Modernists like Lachaise were fascinated by preclassical art because they believed it possessed a primitive vitality. This sculpture represents Lachaise\u2019s first full-scale expression of the idealized female form that would come to dominate his art.",
