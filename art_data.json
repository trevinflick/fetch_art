    "description": "The conical lid of this incense burner, shaped like towering peaks, is associated with the mountainous Isles of the Blessed. These islands were described as the realm of immortal beings (<em>xian</em>) in the Han dynasty religion. Fragrant smoke wafting through holes in the lid of this incense burner would evoke just such a mist-shrouded utopia.",
