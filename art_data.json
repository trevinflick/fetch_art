    "description": "Joaqu\u00edn Torres-Garc\u00eda is a critical figure in the history of modern Latin American art, celebrated for his introduction of Constructivist aesthetics as a natural, indigenous language. In 1926 he settled in Paris, where he formulated the key principles of what he called Constructive Universalism. The number 1 painted at the top reflects his theories about the unity of the individual and the cosmos.",
