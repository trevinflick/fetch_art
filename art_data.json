    "description": "This <em>Waka onna</em> mask was carved out of cypress by Yamaguchi Bidou, one of the few craftsmen in Japan today producing such masks in the traditional manner. It includes distinctive features: a large forehead; downcast, elongated eyes; a small mouth with a protruding lower lip; blackened teeth; and a white complexion. The young woman's expression is kept neutral so that the Noh performer\u2019s gestures can project various emotions.",
