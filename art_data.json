    "description": "This 17th-century drinking cup, made for display on a buffet or sideboard, is a rare example of the work of Hans Ludwig Kienle, a German silversmith who specialized in depicting animals, including horses, lions, and stags. Here, Kienle masterfully rendered the differentiation of human and equine musculature through the contrast of silver and silver-gilt surfaces, thus animating the already dynamic subject.",
