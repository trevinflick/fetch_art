    "description": "Henri Matisse spent most winters in Nice, France, staying at the H\u00f4tel Mediterran\u00e9e. In this painting, Antoinette Arnoux, his favorite model at the time, plays an important role. Not only is she the subject of the painting on the wall, but the composition\u2019s high viewpoint and plunging, wide-angled perspective draw all attention to her as she sits on the balcony, her back to the sea.",
