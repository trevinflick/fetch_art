    "description": "Hughie Lee-Smith here conjures an unsettling scene. Anonymous figures, disconnected from one another, face away from the viewer amid austere terrain. The artist often placed enigmatic people in bleak landscapes, aligning these visualizations with his experiences as an African American: \u201cUnconsciously it has a lot to do with a sense of alienation . . . and in all blacks there is an awareness of their isolation from the mainstream of society.\u201d",
