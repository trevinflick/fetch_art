    "description": "This statue of Shukongojin, the Buddhist Thunderbolt Diety, would have originally stood guard at a temple and was intended to frighten away any thoughts or entities that might distract devotees in the sacred temple space. A fierce protector of the Law of Buddhism, he brandishes a <em>vajra</em>, a ritualistic weapon symbolizing the power of wisdom to penetrate ignorance and destroy evil.",
