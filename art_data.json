    "description": "This Fang head was once inserted into the lid of a cylindrical bark container holding the skull and skeletal remains of an honored ancestor. Stored in the corner of a man\u2019s sleeping room, the sculpture and box protected the ancestor\u2019s bones and kept his power within his descendants' reach. The copper alloy inserts in the eyes would have reflected light in the dark, startling any intruder.",
