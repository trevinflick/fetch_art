    "description": "Since the 1980s Christopher Wool has critically examined the complexities of abstraction and representation through the use of techniques, processes, images, and language taken from popular and vernacular culture. In this work, the aluminum support is silkscreened, overpainted with white, silkscreened a second time, and topped with an explosive, floral-like spray in the center.",
