    "description": "This painting belongs to a group of works by Mir\u00f3 that document his early efforts to grapple with developments in modern art (such as Fauvism and Cubism) and to forge his own direction. The vital and poetic intensity of his later works can be glimpsed here\u2014for example, in the rhythms of the dress, barely held in check by the diamond grid in the background, or in the lyrical note introduced by the small flower on the front of the dress.",
