    "description": "In Central America, the best-known ancient sculptors are the Maya, who decorated their sacred buildings with finely carved stone reliefs. This fragmentary ball-court panel from the late eighth century shows two men, dressed in elaborate costumes, engaged in a ritual ball game. Surrounding the figures, and clearly set off from them, are fragments of hieroglyphs by which the Maya identified the players and the date on which the game occurred.",
