    "description": "The military general Furuta Oribe (1544\u20131615) was a tea connoisseur whose style of presentation at tea gatherings catered to the samurai class and rulers of 17th-century Japan. In contrast to his predecessors, Oribe preferred tea wares that were bold and eccentric rather than subtle and rustic. He was the first to recognize the beauty of artfully misshapen ceramics for use in tea gatherings.",
