    "description": "Paul Klee was a painter, printmaker, critic, and theoretician. He also taught at the Bauhaus, including a basic design course on the theory of form in art. There he developed ideas about the \"polyphony\" of painting, simultaneous sensorial effects created by layering various formal elements. He believed that this type of creative experimentation could \"issue forth a transformed beholder of art\" and thus pave the way for total abstraction.",
