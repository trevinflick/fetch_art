    "description": "Joseph Cornell began making boxes in tribute to ballet in 1940. Inscribed in the lid here is the legend of ballerina Marie Taglioni's encounter with a Russian highwayman who blackmailed her into dancing on rugs spread over a muddy road. The story became entangled in Cornell\u2019s mind with seeing a load of ice spill from a truck at New York\u2019s Grand Central Station, which, he said, \u201cevoked in the most graphic manner the faerie of the Romantic ballet.\u201d",
