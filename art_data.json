    "description": "Vasily Kandinsky was a founding member of Blaue Reiter (Blue Rider), a loose alliance of artists based in Munich. Often working in a common palette and using expressive brushwork, they shared a belief in the symbolic and spiritual importance of forms and colors, including their effect on emotions and memories. Blaue Reiter also promoted a intuitive approach to painting, looking to non-Western, European medieval, and folk art for inspiration.",
