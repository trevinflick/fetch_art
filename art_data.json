    "description": "This painting and <em>Beggar with Oysters</em> were probably conceived as companion pieces. Manet exhibited them together in 1872, along with paintings of an absinthe drinker and a ragpicker, under the collective title <em>Philosophers</em>. Parisian beggars held a particular fascination for Realist artists and writers. By setting his large-scale figures against empty, dark backgrounds, Manet added to their portraitlike, indeed heroic, presence.",
