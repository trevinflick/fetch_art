    "description": "Unlike most prints by Utagawa Hiroshige, this work is based on folklore. Japanese tradition holds that on New Year\u2019s Eve, foxes gather at a specific tree near the Oji Inari Shrine in preparation for a visit there. On the way to the shrine, the foxes produce distinctive flames from their mouths that the local farmers can use to predict the coming year's crops.",
