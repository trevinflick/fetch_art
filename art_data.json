    "description": "Georg Scholz was among a group of young German artists who lived through the cruelty of World War I and returned home to find a weakening economy and mounting political and social problems. Here, the artist exposed society's ills through a meticulously painted realism, which combines Germany's mythic ideals with images of hypocrisy and the base and sordid activities that underlie this seemingly idyllic setting.",
