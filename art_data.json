    "description": "This painting, like many of Manet\u2019s still lifes, recalls 17th-century Dutch models. The directness of execution, bold brushwork, and immediacy of vision, however, suggest why the public found Manet\u2019s work so unorthodox and confrontational. While this painting depicts \u201cdead nature\u201d (<em>nature morte</em> is French for still life), there is nothing still about the work: the produce seems fresh and the handling of the paint vigorous.",
