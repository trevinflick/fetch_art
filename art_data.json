    "description": "Through 1890 and 1891, Monet created a series of paintings depicting the stacks of wheat that stood outside his farmhouse in Giverny. He painted at several easels simultaneously in the field and then refined pictorial harmonies in the studio. In most of the winter views, like this one, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season.",
