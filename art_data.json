    "description": "This painting is a blend of fact and fiction. The gallery space features eight sculptures by leading artists, all which were displayed at the Whitney Museum in 1940. The three images on the back walls appear to be part of the show, but they are invented works, paintings Shahn drew from his own photographs of working-class people. The figures in them are positioned to see into the gallery, but they are excluded from the \u201creal\u201d space of the museum.",
