    "description": "This painting's model may be the woman Renoir went on to marry, Aline Charigot. He depicted her here with vibrant color, a light-filled atmosphere, and freely handled paint. While blue dominates the composition, there are striking contrasts of red and touches of yellow. These primary colors in close proximity optically mix, enlivening the composition with a sense of spontaneity.",
