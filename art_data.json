    "description": "This panel depicts a suckling calf with his mother, whose placid eyes, floppy ears, undulating dewlap, upwardly curving horns, and hump identify her as belonging to the distinctive breed of Brahman cattle originally bred in India, where they enjoy a respected status. Cows are regarded as nourishing mothers, as depicted here, and even their waste is used both in purification rituals and for fuel.",
