    "description": "Corot rarely exhibited his late figure paintings like this compelling example, focusing instead on his idyllic landscapes. While here he chose a traditional subject\u2014the muse-like image of a woman reading a book\u2014Corot showed his model pausing and looking up. He also used unconventionally bold brushwork while still delighting in detail\u2014the ribbon in the model\u2019s hair, the delicate earrings, and the deep folds in the skirt.",
