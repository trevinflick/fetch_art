    "description": "An asymmetrical water scene wraps around the body of this pitcher. The vignette was almost certainly inspired by the work of Katsushika Hokusai, a Japanese artist known for his dynamic woodblock prints of the natural world. Tiffany and Company\u2019s design library included three volumes of Hokusai\u2019s work, many featuring the same graceful irises, enlivened dragonflies, and splashing carp visible on this pitcher.",
