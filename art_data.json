    "description": "Among the German Expressionists, who used strong color and exaggerated form to express emotional content, Franz Marc was unique in his empathic interest in animal life. He painted this work following a sojourn to the Italian town of Merano. Its title refers to the \"magical\" harmony he sensed there between human life, represented by the houses and mill on the left, and nature, embodied by the lyrical region of trees and animals on the right.",
