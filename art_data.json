    "description": "Although this painting features the bold highlights, elongated figures, and vibrant colors characteristic of El Greco\u2019s late career, the artist enlisted his workshop to execute some parts of the scene. The heads of the figures reflect the work of different artists, including likely the artist\u2019s son, Jorge Manuel. The fantastical background, possibly conceived by an assistant, is unlike any other by El Greco.",
