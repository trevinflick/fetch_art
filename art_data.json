    "description": "In the 1890s Louis Comfort Tiffany began using his opalescent Favrile glass to produce lamps, the form for which he would become most famous. As the artistic director of Tiffany Studios, he approved all patterns but created relatively few lamps himself. Clara Driscoll, head of the Women\u2019s Glass Cutting Department, designed the majority of the firm\u2019s lamps, including, likely, this one.",
