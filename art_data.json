    "description": "Natalia Goncharova designed sets and costumes for Sergei Diaghilev\u2019s traveling ballet company, the Ballets Russes. Her costume for the Spanish dancer in this work features delicate transparencies of lace and floral patterns. Inspired by the flamenco tradition, Goncharova fanned the fabric outward geometrically from the dancer's hands, building upon the abstract-cubist style she had developed in Moscow the decade before.",
