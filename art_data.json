    "description": "This small container was designed to hold kohl, a cosmetic eye paint made of ground galena or malachite. Ancient Egyptian men and women wore kohl for its aesthetic appeal but also to dampen the harsh sunlight of North Africa and possibly even for medicinal purposes. Columns shaped like palm trees were common in ancient Egyptian architecture and inspired the elegant form of this glass vessel.",
