    "description": "Among the various Bamileke kingdoms in the Grassfields region, porcupine quills are reserved for the king\u2019s use. As part of a ceremonial hat like this, the quills express the ruler\u2019s sacred role. A king can apply his special powers and qualities, including the ability to capture and control animals and other natural elements, to protect himself and his people from external threats.",
