    "description": "Collier was well known in his own time for his still lifes, which replicated in intricate detail actual maps and globes. Here, he reproduced a portion of Frederik de Wit\u2019s 1660 map of the Americas and Jodocus Hondius\u2019s terrestrial globe with a view of Mexico, both of which allude to the Dutch Republic\u2019s international trade networks and the ambition to possess the world through cartographic knowledge.",
