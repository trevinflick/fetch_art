    "description": "In this terracotta sculpture, a pouting putto and his companion flank an elaborate candelabra with a lit torch. The surfaces of the baby bodies and architectural elements retain the marks of the sculptor\u2019s tools, an indication that this work is not a finished product. Artists often used terracotta, a type of reddish-brown ceramic, for models that then served as guides for their assistants to begin carving the final version.",
