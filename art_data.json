    "description": "Piet Mondrian, a founding member of the international movement De Stijl (the Style), said \u201cthe straight line tells the truth.\u201d Deceptively simple, his works are the result of continual tinkering to achieve absolute balance and harmony. In this work, Mondrian rotated a square canvas 90 degrees to create a dynamic relationship between the rectilinear composition and the diagonal lines of the painting's edges.",
