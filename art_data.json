    "description": "Helena Vieira da Silva moved from her native Portugal for Paris, where she worked with such artists as Fernand L\u00e9ger and began incorporating abstraction into her work. Looking at the work of Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda and Pierre Bonnard, as well as the azulejos (floor and wall tiles) of Portugal, she developed a distinct style that balances the organic and familiar, the hermetic and strange.",
