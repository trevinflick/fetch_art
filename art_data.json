    "description": "Filled with tormented and deformed figures in dark, unresolved dramas, Francis Bacon\u2019s paintings embody the existential mindset of the post\u2013World War II era. Bacon often interpreted historical artworks through his own bleak mentality. This painting is part of a series he devoted to Diego Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s <em>Portrait of Pope Innocent X</em>. Instead of the noble drapery surrounding Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s pope, Bacon's is flanked by beef carcasses.",
