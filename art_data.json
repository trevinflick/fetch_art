    "description": "Joseph Cornell\u2019s bird boxes often play with forms of representation and with the contrast between the natural and the artificial. In his trips into the countryside, he would often gather materials for his boxes, like the large piece of bark placed toward the right interior edge here. This bark adds a sense of depth to the box by providing a kind of opened curtain from behind which the owl is revealed.",
