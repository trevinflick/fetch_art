    "description": "Surrealist Max Ernst used an unusually wide range of styles and techniques to create his works. In 1925, he developed a method called frottage, which involved rubbing paper or canvas over a textured surface to create an image. In <em>Forest and Sun</em>, the wood grain patterns become a cluster of towering forms recalling a forest, a source of fear and fascination for Ernst since his youth.",
