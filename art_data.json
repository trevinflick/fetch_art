    "description": "This basalt sculpture, carved in the round, depicts Karttikeya, the Hindu god of war, with six heads (<em>shanmukha</em>) and 12 arms, 10 of which hold weapons. According to legend, Karttikeya was born from the spilled seed of the Hindu divinity Shiva. He developed his six heads in order to nurse from his six mothers, the Pleiades (or Krittikas\u2014hence his name, Karttikeya), a constellation of stars.",
