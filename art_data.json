    "description": "This drum, representing a high-ranking woman balancing a load on her head, celebrates women\u2019s prominence in Senufo society, where they act as family founders and spiritual mediators and guardians. The drum's embellished designs allude to the knowledge and power of diviners. This particular object may have been played by a woman during funerals for members of the influential all-female associations known as Sandogo and Tyekpa.",
