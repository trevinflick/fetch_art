    "description": "Before achieving renown as a muralist, Diego Rivera lived in Paris amid Pablo Picasso\u2019s circle and enjoyed a brief but sparkling period as a Cubist painter. In this work he portrayed his then-lover, the Russian-born painter and writer Marevna Vorob\u00ebv-Stebelska, with her distinctive bobbed hair, blond bangs, and prominent nose. Following World War I and the Russian Revolution, Rivera rejected Cubism as frivolous and inappropriate.",
