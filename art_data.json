    "description": "This representation of a horse, fully decorated with saddle, stirrups, and bell ornaments, is a <em>haniwa</em>, a terracotta figure made for ritual and funerary use. Found northeast of Tokyo, this clay figure would have likely been at a burial mound, in an area filled with figurines and animal forms, perhaps meant to represent the possessions the deceased hoped to take with them after death.",
