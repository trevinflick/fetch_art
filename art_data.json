    "description": "Ren\u00e9 Magritte began painting glass bottles during the German occupation of Belgium in World War II, a moment when traditional fine art materials were suddenly in short supply. Although he had previously experimented with found objects and sculpture, Magritte did not conceive of painting \u201cin the round\u201d until the war years, using discarded bottles\u2014many of his favored Bordeaux, but also port and sherry. Magritte created more than 25 works in this format.",
