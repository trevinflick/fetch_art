    "description": "Shiva Maheshvara (the Great Lord) and his divine mate, Uma (also called Parvati), sympolize the ideal Hindu couple. Shiva is most commonly worshipped in abstract <em>linga</em> form, but he also came to represent the perfect family man. Here, he is seated on his bull Nandi, with Uma resting on Shiva's thigh. Their sons, elephant-headed Ganesha and Skanda Karttikeya astride his peacock, appear among the figures at the base.",
