    "description": "This picture takes its subject from the life of Lycurgus, a legendary ninth-century b.c. Spartan lawgiver whose social reforms included an unusual method of physical training in which adolescent girls competed on an equal footing with boys, exercising nude in public. Degas would have worked up this monochromatic sketch with layers of color had he completed it, but he left it unfinished when he began a second version of the subject .",
