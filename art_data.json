    "description": "The four large canvases by Hubert Robert in the Art Institute's collection were commissioned by wealthy \ufb01nancier Jean-Joseph, Marquis de Laborde, to decorate a salon in his ch\u00e2teau at M\u00e9r\u00e9ville, France. Robert was much sought after as a painter of architectural ruins, a genre that appealed to the late 18th-century taste for the antique. He cultivated his knowledge of antiquity over more than a decade of travel and study in Italy.",
