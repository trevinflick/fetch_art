    "description": "\u00c9milie Charmy was among the first women to exhibit paintings in the Fauvist style, marked by an expressionistic and nonnaturalistic use of color. In this boldly hued landscape, she captured the coastal town of L\u2019Estaque, popular with French painters. The swelling shapes along the composition\u2019s edges produce a sense of movement that dissipates at the center in the calm waters of the Bay of Marseille.",
