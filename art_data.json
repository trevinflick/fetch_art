    "description": "Guanyin is the Bodhisattva of Compassion, one of the most beloved Chinese Buddhist deities. He can be identified by the small figure of Amituo (Amitabha), Buddha of the Western Paradise, in his headdress. His pose\u2014seated with one leg hanging and his right arm resting on the other knee\u2014further distinguishes him as Guanyin of the Southern Sea, a reference to the deity\u2019s island home.",
