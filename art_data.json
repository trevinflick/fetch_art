    "description": "The French Revolution probably accounts for this portrait's unfinished state. While David completed the stippled underpainting, he did not create the smooth surface characteristic of his finished paintings. He did not even place a needle and thread in the subject's hand. Objecting to David\u2019s revolutionary ideals, Madame de Pastoret refused the painting but had her adult son purchase the portrait after the artist's death.",
