    "description": "Typical of Cezanne\u2019s work, this painting is carefully considered and the composition hard-won: the traces of at least three other pieces of fruit at lower left attest to Cezanne's struggles to make the arrangement work. Even in the final version, there remains a tense spatial relationship between the objects, which seem to float in the picture plane rather than being anchored to the tabletop.",
