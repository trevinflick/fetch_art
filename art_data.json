    "description": "David Garrick, one of the most influential actors of 18th century Britain, appears here in the guise of the titular character from Shakespeare\u2019s <em>King Lear</em>, a role he played numerous times on the stage. In this portrait, made after Garrick\u2019s passing and based on prints created from his death mask, the actor wears a crown of wheat and flowers in reference to a famous scene in the play during which the king rages at a storm, daring it to harm him.",
