    "description": "This famous work is from Picasso\u2019s Blue Period (1901\u201304), a time the artist restricted himself to a cold, monochromatic blue palette and flattened forms to convey the themes of misery and alienation. The elongated figure also reflects his interest in the great 16th-century Spanish artist El Greco. The 22-year-old Picasso had sympathy for the downtrodden; at the time, knew what it meant to be penniless.",
