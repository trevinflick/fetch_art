    "description": "With all of his works, Izumi Masatoshi carefully scouts for the stone he wants to use. For <em>Islands</em>, he cleaved one large stone, weighing about 12,000 pounds, into the three-part sculpture. While the finished work may still appear raw, meticulously cutting and polishing has amplified the natural character of the stone. And while the work was made quite recently, it recalls the traditional Japanese reverence for natural materials.",
