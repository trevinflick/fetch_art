    "description": "This statuette depicts Venus, Roman goddess of love, sexuality, and maternity, wearing nothing but the diadem (crown) atop her head. Earlier images often represented her modestly clothed, reinforcing her role as mother of the Roman people. By the first century, Venus was regularly shown fully nude, reflecting body types associated with her Greek counterpart, Aphrodite, whose domain leaned more toward the pleasures of erotic love and seduction.",
