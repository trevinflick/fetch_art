    "description": "Monet probably painted this and other still lifes knowing that they would be more marketable than his landscapes. Here, however, he used the complexity of color, light, and texture found in his most Impressionist landscapes. Particularly evident in the cloth's surface\u2014the light on the horizontal brushstrokes recalls earlier works in which he used similar horizontals of variegated colors to suggest water rippling in the sunlight.",
