    "description": "Francisco de Goya explored satirical and popular aspects of Spanish life. This work, from a series about the notorious criminal El Maragato, features his capture. After escaping prison, El Maragato spent two months stealing food, guns, and money before trying to take Friar Pedro de Saldivia and other people hostage. The friar outsmarted the bandit, however, seizing his gun and shooting him in the thigh.",
