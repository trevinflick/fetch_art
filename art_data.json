    "description": "Cy Twombly is best known for a synthesis of drawing, painting, and writing that balances abstract and pictorial impulses. He made this work during the summer of 1969 while staying on the shores of Lake Bolsena in Italy. Though he often found inspiration in history, here he was attuned to that summer\u2019s defining moment: the <em>Apollo II</em> moon landing. Such context enhances our reading of the painting\u2019s language of measurement, drift, and direction.",
