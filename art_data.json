    "description": "One of Toulouse-Lautrec\u2019s favorite haunts was the Cirque Fernando, also the subject of his large painting, <em>Equestrienne (At the Cirque Fernando)</em>. Like many of the artists in his circle, Toulouse-Lautrec experimented with styles and materials beyond easel painting. His decision to paint on a tambourine with little castanets was perhaps inspired by the instrument\u2019s association with bohemian life and creative freedom.",
