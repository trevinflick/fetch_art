    "description": "Monet painted this work in his late 20s when he was not yet widely known but was already using radical techniques to depict scenes from modern life, such as this one, featuring his future wife, Camille Doncieux. At the time, viewers were used to paintings that aimed to mirror reality, with a smooth traditional paint surface. To them Monet's approach seemed shockingly unfinished and illegible.",
