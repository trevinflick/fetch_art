    "description": "Evoking a female body through simplified shapes that suggest a head, shoulders, chest, and a wide, concave womb, this sculpture was inspired by a ceremonial ladle created by the Dan communities of Liberia and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Giacometti appreciated these objects, known as a <em>wakemia</em> or <em>wunkirmian</em>, for their geometry and literal rendering of bodily volumes\u2014an alternative approach to Western modes of modeling and carving.",
