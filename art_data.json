    "description": "Starting in 1900, young artists migrated to Paris's Montparnasse neighborhood, a hub of avant-garde activity. Jacques Lipchitz moved to there in 1909 and, becoming friends with Diego Rivera, Pablo Picasso, and others, began participating in the Cubist movement. The style's fractured geometric forms and favored subject matter (such as musicians and seated bathers) can be seen in both his bas-reliefs and sculptures in the round like <em>Seated Figure</em>.",
