    "description": "Cosmetic containers in celadon, also known as greenware, were widely used during Korea's Goryeo dynasty (918\u20131392) by ladies of the court and aristocratic households. Often beautifully adorned with floral motifs, these containers held face powder, blush, hair oil, or fragrance and became prized possessions among elite women. This particular example, features a bulbous shape and intricately carved peonies, a symbol of wealth and beauty.",
