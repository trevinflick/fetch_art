    "description": "In the 1940s, Jackson Pollock developed a revolutionary style of Abstract Expressionism by dripping, pouring, and splashing paint onto canvases. <em>Greyed Rainbow</em> is a quintessential example of his \"action painting\"\u2014one of his last purely abstract canvases before his death in 1956. While the canvas is predominantly black, white, and gray, Pollock thinly concealed various colors in the lower third, perhaps giving the work its title.",
