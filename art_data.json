    "description": "In paintings made for his own pleasure, Goya explored popular aspects of Spanish life. This series was inspired by the capture of notorious criminal El Maragato by Friar Pedro de Saldivia. After escaping from prison, El Maragato spent two months stealing food, guns, and money before trying to take Friar Pedro and other people hostage. The friar outsmarted the bandit, however, seizing his gun, shooting him in the thigh and finally tying him up.",
