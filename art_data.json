    "description": "William Sidney Mount was one of the first American artists to specialize in scenes of everyday life. Here, Mount portrayed a boisterous group of patrons in a country tavern. Standing in the back corner is an African American figure who, as a free black man in 1830s New York, may have been able to frequent the tavern but did not participate fully in this community.",
