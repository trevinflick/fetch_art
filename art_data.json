    "description": "Chicago artist Ivan Albright executed this horrific work for the 1945 movie adaptation of Oscar Wilde\u2019s 1891 novel <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>. In Wilde\u2019s tale, the youthful and attractive Gray sells his soul in order to stay young. In his stead, a portrait of the young hedonist decays, recording his moral corruption in paint as he leads an increasingly wayward life.",
