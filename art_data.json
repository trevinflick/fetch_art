    "description": "This work belongs to a distinct group of Owl Boxes Cornell created in the mid-1940s. During this time the artist was taking frequent rural bike rides around his home on Utopia Parkway in Flushing, New York, to gather grasses, bark, and twigs. Surrounded by these natural materials, Cornell felt his boxes were \u201clike a bird\u2019s own nest,\u201d and this realization, he wrote, \u201cwas inexpressibly satisfying in such a warm and redolent atmosphere.\u201d",
