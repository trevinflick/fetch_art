    "description": "Thomas Cole is best known for his scenes of American wilderness, but he also rendered pastoral views of cultivated landscapes, like this painting of New Hampshire\u2019s White Mountains. The prominent church spire emphasizes the role of religion in agrarian society, and the sun's glow expresses optimism for rural America. Painted at a time of rapid industrialization, the work conveys an ideal that was increasingly far from reality.",
