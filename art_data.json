    "description": "Animal-shaped vessels are the rarest of all Shang ritual bronzes. This creature is a fascinating blend of alert poise and solemn dignity. The scaled pattern on the neck and tail suggests the feathers of a bird, while other details reference more fantastical creatures. A dragon and a coiled serpent embellish each wing, and monster masks crown the head as well as the removable lid.",
