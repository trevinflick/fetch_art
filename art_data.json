    "description": "This box is covered in designs typical of a Northwest Coast art called formline. Here, James Johnson create images of animals from ovoid shapes and U-forms, which combine to make faces along the corners of the box. He carved and painted them over a single, continuous plank of yellow cedar. After adding grooves called kerfs and steaming the wood to make it pliable, he bent it at the corners to create the box\u2019s shape.",
