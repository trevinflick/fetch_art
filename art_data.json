    "description": "In the 1870s James McNeill Whistler took a radical step toward abstraction with his \"Nocturnes\" series. In keeping with his art-for-art\u2019s-sake creed, these works capture the stillness of evening while evoking the artistry of music. The subject of this work\u2014an inlet along the English Channel\u2014is obscured by the approaching night, allowing Whistler to fully explore the tonal harmonies of darkness.",
