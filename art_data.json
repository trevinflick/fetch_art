    "description": "Serene benevolence emanates from this beautifully sculpted marble head of the bodhisattva Guanyin, made in far northern China in the late sixth century. The figure has many classic Buddhist features, including the concave forehead circle (<em>urna</em>)\u2014an auspicious mark from which wisdom radiates\u2014and elongated earlobes, an allusion to the aristocratic Indian custom of wearing heavy earrings and thus to the Buddha's early life as an Indian prince.",
