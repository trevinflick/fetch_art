    "description": "In the 1980s Brice Marden developed a fluid, calligraphic line that resulted in shimmering, interlaced compositions, as shown in this work. His paintings slow down the spontaneous brushwork of gestural abstraction to an almost meditative pace. Though it is called a \u201cstudy,\u201d Marden reworked this painting across nearly a decade, completing it in his studio in Eagles Mere, Pennsylvania, which he describes as the most \u201cZen-like\u201d of his workspaces.",
