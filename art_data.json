    "description": "One of the notable artistic accomplishments of Korea's Goryeo period was the production of sculptural celadons like this duck-shaped vessel. The duck\u2019s tail forms a handle, which supports a human figure who holds a bowl to receive wine, and its beak is the spout. The figure's clothing indicates he is a Daoist immortal and suggests this ewer was used for ritual or ceremonial purposes.",
