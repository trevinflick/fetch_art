    "description": "Cornell was passionate about ballet, particularly 19th-century Romantic ballets like <em>Swan Lake</em> and their star ballerinas. This assemblage combines a photo of ballerina Tamara Toumanova with images of butterflies and sea creatures, evoking both an aerial and underwater world. Cornell might have been suggesting that Toumanova is a star who may take her place among the constellations, alongside mythical figures like the Greek and Roman goddesses.",
