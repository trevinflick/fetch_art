    "description": "In this still life, Paul Cezanne disrupted expectations for painting in the late 1870s by tipping the tabletop and plate forward toward the viewer and constructing a table with edges that don\u2019t quite align. These disorienting details are complemented by the heavy, sculptural forms he created by using a pointed tool to incise contours around the plate and some of the apples.",
