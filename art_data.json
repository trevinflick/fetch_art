    "description": "Painted in the summer of 1965, when Georgia O\u2019Keeffe was 77 years old, this monumental work is the final painting in a series the artist made based on her experiences as an airplane passenger. Because of its size and its status as an icon of the museum's collection, the work has not left the Art Institute since it came into the building in 1983.",
