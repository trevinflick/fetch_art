    "description": "In the mid-19th century, dining room furniture featured ornament that was intended to reinforce ideals of hospitality and gentility, like the panels depicting Aesop's Fables on this sideboard. This piece resembles the furniture designed by notable architect Frank Furness, who frequently collaborated with cabinetmaker Daniel Pabst. Although details of the carving tie it to Pabst, the design cannot be attributed conclusively to a particular hand.",
