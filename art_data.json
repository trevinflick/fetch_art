    "description": "John Singer Sargent was one of the most fashionable portraitists in late 19th-century Europe and America. Extravagant color and brushwork were central to Sargent\u2019s success, as was his ability to present a refined image of his sitter. Here, Sargent accentuated Mrs. George Swinton's regal bearing and feminine dress, harmonizing the realism of her face with bursts of impressionistic brushstrokes describing her gown's shimmering fabric.",
