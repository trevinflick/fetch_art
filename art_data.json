    "description": "This stone, commemorating the beginning of Emperor Motecuhzoma II's reign, was originally located within the ritual center of Tenochtitlan, the capital of the empire conquered by the Aztecs between 1428 and 1519. The city's ruins lie beneath modern-day Mexico City. The sculpture legitimizes Motecuhzoma\u2019s rule as part of the cosmic cycle and presents him as heir to the world in the present era of creation.",
