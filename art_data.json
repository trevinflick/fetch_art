    "description": "While Jasper Johns has worked with stencils of alphabet letters since the 1950s, this is his only painting that shows a single sequence from A to Z. We might try to read this painting in order, letter by letter, from top left to bottom right. But the jumble of strokes, smudges, and collaged fragments of painted paper scatters our eyes across the surface, challenging any sense of sequential progress.",
