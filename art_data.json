    "description": "In the late 1930s Jackson Pollock became inspired by the work of the Mexican muralists Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros. The expressionistic style of <em>Untitled</em> recalls Orozco murals that Pollock saw at Pomona and Dartmouth Colleges. The bullfight imagery evokes Picasso's famous <em>Guernica</em>, which made a powerful impression on Pollock when he saw the painting in 1939.",
