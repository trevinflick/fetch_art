    "description": "Here, Rubens presented a distinctly human take on the figures of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. They lack the halos that often identify them, and the adult characters wear contemporary Flemish attire. Mary\u2019s exposed breast brings to mind Jesus\u2019s need for physical nourishment as the human son of God. Her central placement underscores the growing veneration of Mary in the Catholic community of the Spanish Netherlands.",
