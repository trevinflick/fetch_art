    "description": "Ivory was used to make highly prized devotional objects in the Gothic era. This triptych, featuring scenes from the life of Jesus Christ, might have been kept on a stand or cabinet in a bedroom and used as a focus for prayer along with an illuminated Psalter or Book of Hours. The intimate scale and movable wings made the triptych easy to store or carry.",
