    "description": "Edgar Degas first painted dancers as an independent subject in 1871. He would go on to devote almost half his output as an artist to this subject, observing countless performances and rehearsals at the Paris Op\u00e9ra. Here, he placed the viewer in the wings, as if among the elite opera subscribers who paid for the privilege to roam and socialize backstage.",
