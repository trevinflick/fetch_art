    "description": "When completed in 1950, Willem de Kooning's <em>Excavation</em> was his largest painting. The composition straddles representation and abstraction with its structure of hooked, calligraphic lines that define bird and fish shapes, human noses, eyes, teeth, necks, and jaws. The apt title reflects his painting process: an intensive building up of the surface and scraping down of its paint layers until the desired effect was achieved.",
