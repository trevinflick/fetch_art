    "description": "After moving to Paris in 1920, Joan Mir\u00f3 met a group of avant-garde artists who advocated merging the everyday world with dreams and the unconscious to produce an absolute reality, or surreality. In <em>The Policeman</em>, Mir\u00f3 derives an image of a mustachioed policeman and his horse from seemingly unplanned stains on the canvas and graffiti-like strokes and squiggles, as if composing without conscious intention.",
