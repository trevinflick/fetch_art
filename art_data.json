    "description": "James McNeill Whistler painted marine subjects throughout his career. In this painting, he focused on the industrial nature of London's Thames River\u2014boats and barges, laboring men, and smoking chimneys. Despite the realism of the subject, Whistler unified the composition with deft brushwork and a subtle palette of brown and gray that anticipates his later interest in delicate tonal harmonies.",
