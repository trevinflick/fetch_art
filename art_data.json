    "description": "The <em>mwana pwo</em> mask is a popular and frequent presence in Chokwe entertainment masquerades. While it represents a female ancestor\u2014symbolizing fertility and the prominent role of women in Chokwe society\u2014the mask is always worn by a male dancer. The features of this particular example, while idealized, suggest the individuality of a portrait, raising the possibility that it may be modeled on a particular woman.",
