    "description": "Stebbins belonged to a community of women sculptors in Rome. Like their male colleagues, they sought to emulate the statues of antiquity. In a rare pair of marble statues, Stebbins portrays a machinist and his apprentice, an unusual theme in mid-19th-century American sculpture. Stebbins innovatively rendered a modern subject in the refined, neoclassical visual language traditionally used to depict biblical, historical, and mythological subjects.",
