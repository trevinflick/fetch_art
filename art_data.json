    "description": "Among the boldest and the most brilliantly colored of Max Beckmann\u2019s self-portraits, this work was perhaps the last painting the artist completed in Berlin before he and his wife fled to the Netherlands\u2014just two days after Adolf Hitler delivered a speech condemning modern art. In 1937, shortly after this work was made, more than 500 of his works were confiscated from German public collections.",
