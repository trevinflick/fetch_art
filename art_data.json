    "description": "This small, finely crafted lacquer figure represents a Buddhist bodhisattva, or <em>bosatsu</em>, an enlightened and compassionate being who postponed Buddhahood in order to help save others. Calm, stately, and full-bodied, the <em>bosatsu</em> is seated in a meditative pose; his gracefully held hands, raised midair, make a gesture of assurance. This sculpture was originally gilt; traces of gold remain on the bodhisattva's face and chest.",
