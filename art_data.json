    "description": "Monet arrived in \u00c9tretat, on the Normandy coast, with his family for a vacation in September 1885. By the time he left in December he had initiated 51 canvases, many of which he reworked back at his studio in Giverny. The majority feature the rock formations that flank the bay of \u00c9tretat. These subjects proved to be among Monet\u2019s most precipitous and enchanting: the location was as physically dangerous to navigate as it was sublime to behold.",
