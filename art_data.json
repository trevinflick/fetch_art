    "description": "In this portrait, Gauguin depicts the 13-year-old Tahitian girl Tehamana in a missionary dress holding a Samoan fan. A ripe mango alludes to fertility. In the background, Gauguin combined various non-European emblems\u2014glyphs derived from an Easter Island tablet and a female deity inspired by Polynesian and Hindu sources\u2014to build a generic sense of foreignness, transforming Tehamana into the embodiment of his own imagination.",
