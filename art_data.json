    "description": "Richard Hunt made <em>Hero Construction</em> in 1958, a year after he graduated from the School of the Art Institute. He welded together found objects\u2014old pipes, bits of metal, and automobile parts\u2014that he discovered in junkyards and on the street. The resulting figure assumes a stance that recalls past heroes, from ancient Greek sculptures of gods and champions to more recent monuments of generals and political leaders.",
