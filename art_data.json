    "description": "Inspired by a personal photograph, this work reflects Vallotton's focus on the daily life of his household. This example employs bold blocks of solid color: the red of the bed and the pink of the child's dress, for example. The result is a graphic simplicity similar to the artist's woodblock prints of interior scenes created during this same period.",
