    "description": "During World War I, after several years of inactivity because of bad health and grief over the death of his second wife, Claude Monet embarked on a period of intense work. He began a group of monumental water lily paintings that he would later offer to the French state. Alongside the project, he painted a suite of 19 smaller canvases, including this one.",
