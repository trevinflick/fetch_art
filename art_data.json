    "description": "Rubens executed this study and 38 more as he prepared to decorate the ceiling of the Jesuit church in Antwerp. It shows a foreshortened saint gliding majestically on a cloud. The bold perspective would have furthered the illusion that the painting was a window in the church's ceiling, offering a view to the sky. The man depicted is the 12th-century martyr Albert of Louvain, patron saint of Archduke Albert, governor of the Spanish Netherlands.",
