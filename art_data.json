    "description": "This painting exemplifies Yves Tanguy's late style. Unlike the amorphous creatures of his earlier paintings, the forms here are harder and more sculptural, resembling strangely shaped stones. The title of the painting\u2014<em>The Rapidity of Sleep</em>\u2014works in conjunction with the image to heighten its enigma and mystery. Is Tanguy referring to the sleep that ushers in the dream world of his landscapes or to the ultimate sleep, the sleep of death?",
