    "description": "Talavera poblana, a tin-glazed earthenware, has been made in the Mexican town of Puebla since the 16th century. Though its colors and motifs were influenced by fashionable imported ceramics, Spanish and Mexican artisans adapted designs to reflect local cultural symbols. The owners of this jar likely added the locking metal lid to protect valuables such as cocoa beans, which were expensive at this time.",
