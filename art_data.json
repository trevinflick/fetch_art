    "description": "Frank Lloyd Wright designed this desk and armchair as part of his plan for the offices of the S.C. Johnson company. Their curved forms and earth tones echo the project's architectural designs. Wright\u2014renowned for integrating the exterior and interior\u2014furnished designs based on principles of nature and often resisted changes to his designs. This three-legged chair, however, proved unsteady, and he altered later versions to have four feet.",
