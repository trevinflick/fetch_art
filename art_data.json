    "description": "One of America\u2019s most famous paintings, <em>American Gothic</em> debuted at the Art Institute of Chicago, winning Grant Wood a $300 prize and instant fame. Wood used his sister and dentist as models, depicting them in front of an 1880s-style house. While the painting is often seen as a satirical commentary on the Midwestern character, Wood intended it to a positive statement about rural American values.",
