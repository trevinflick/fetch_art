    "description": "This work is among Cy Twombly\u2019s best-known and earliest sculptures. Once painted stark white, it is now evocatively weathered. The work presents a fence-like array of spoon handles and other shafts of wood that were wrapped together with bands of cloth and mounted on a stepped platform. It can be read\u2014either separately or simultaneously\u2014as depicting a powerful \u201cfetish\u201d object, a set of mute panpipes, or an unidentified archaeological fragment.",
