    "description": "This skillfully decorated Athenian plate was made to serve the sea life it depicts. A scallop sits between a gilt-head bream and a red mullet. Opposite them, a lettered perch confronts a spiny scorpion fish. Shells, a small fish, and a mollusk or crustacean ring the outside. The central cavity, decorated with wave patterns, would have collected the delicious juices from the cooked fish.",
