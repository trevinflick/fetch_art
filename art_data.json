    "description": "One of 68 miniature rooms imagined by Narcissa Thorne to evoke historic interiors across the centuries, this room explores the elegant restraint of contemporary design from the 1930s. Thorne took the extraordinary step of commissioning original, tiny paintings for this space from renowned Cubist artists Fernand L\u00e9ger and Amad\u00e9e Ozenfant, as well as a studio pottery piece from Gertrud Natzler.",
