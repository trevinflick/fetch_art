    "description": "Most ancient Roman homes had domestic shrines called lararia that included bronze statuettes of household gods (the Lares) and other deities. This statuette likely belonged to such a shrine and is thought to depict Concordia, the Roman personification of harmony, a principal virtue of the Roman Empire. She likely held a libation dish in her right hand and a cornucopia in her missing left hand.",
