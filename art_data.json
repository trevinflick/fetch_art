    "description": "A native Chicagoan and graduate of the School of the Art Institute, Motley used his art to represent the vibrancy of African American culture, frequently portraying young, sophisticated city dwellers out on the town. One of Motley\u2019s most celebrated paintings, <em>Nightlife</em> depicts a crowded cabaret in the South Side Bronzeville neighborhood. The dynamic composition, intense lighting, and heightened colors vividly express the scene's liveliness.",
