    "description": "Guido Reni was the most famous and successful Italian painter of his day. This painting depicts Salome receiving the head of John the Baptist on a platter, the gruesome reward she chose for having pleased her stepfather, Herod, by performing a seductive dance. This episode from the New Testament had long been popular in Italian art thanks to its combination of religiosity, violence, and eroticism.",
