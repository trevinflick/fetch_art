    "description": "Caillebotte may have been inspired by the butcher\u2019s shop below his family home in Paris when he painted this bloody scene of animal parts ready for human consumption. The painting confronts viewers with objects that are visually unpleasant and yet rendered with highly decorative pastel colors and soft brushstrokes.",
