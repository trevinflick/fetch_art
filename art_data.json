    "description": "This bowl was commissioned by Eleanor Roosevelt in celebration of her husband Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s re-election as governor of New York, and it has since become an icon of the Jazz Age and an the Art Deco period. Cowan Pottery liked Viktor Schreckengost's design and put the bowl into production. Using Schreckengost\u2019s template, artisans scratched the design into the bowl's surface. Schreckengost then inspected and signed each bowl.",
