    "description": "Through 1890 and 1891, Monet created a series of paintings depicting the stacks of wheat that stood outside his farmhouse in Giverny. These stacks were, for the artist, a symbol of sustenance and survival. He painted at several easels simultaneously in the field and then refined pictorial harmonies in the studio. The Art Institute has the world's largest group of Monet\u2019s <em>Stacks of Wheat</em>.",
