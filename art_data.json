    "description": "Described as \u201cthe sculptor of gesture,\u201d George Minne explored the imagery of kneeling youths throughout his career. The posture of this thin young man suggests physical and psychological self-enclosure, but it is unclear whether the composition embodies torment, grief, resignation, or even languor. This uncertainty enhances the work\u2019s mystery and reflects the artist\u2019s interest in Symbolism, a movement that prized indeterminate, personal meaning.",
