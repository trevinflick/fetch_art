    "description": "This elegant piece epitomizes the Late Baroque style that flourished in Newport, Rhode Island. It is one of six bureaus attributed to John Townsend on the basis of similar construction and design features in labeled pieces by the maker. Bureau tables most likely functioned as dressing tables and were particularly popular among the Quaker citizens of Newport, who appreciated their wide array of storage possibilities.",
