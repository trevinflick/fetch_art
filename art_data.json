    "description": "Two groups of working-class travelers, one with a slaughtered pig in tow, converge on an icy road during a snowstorm. Goya captured the scene\u2019s wintry atmosphere with barren trees, large swaths of cool grays and whites, and diagonal brushstrokes that convey rapid snowfall. This painting is one of a series of studies Goya created for monumental tapestries depicting the four seasons, commissioned for a dining hall at the Royal Palace of El Pardo in Spain.",
