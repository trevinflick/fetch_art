    "description": "This 18th-century folding screen, part of a pair, is by one of the best known painters in Japan, Soga Sh\u014dhaku, revered for his unusual subjects and eccentric style. This screen focuses on the iconic Mount Fuji, a sacred site since ancient times. Sh\u043e\u0304haku depicted the mountain completely covered in snow, painting it in negative. The white of the mountain is the color of the bare paper, and the outlines of the peak are done with ink wash.",
