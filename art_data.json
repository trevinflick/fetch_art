    "description": "Jasper Johns chose numbers as subjects because they are \"conventional, depersonalized, factual\"\u2014freeing him from any obligation to construct a visual narrative. With <em>Figure 4</em> he played with the number's meaning, winking at the tradition of \u201cfigural\u201d painting and evoking the homophone \"for\" in the title to create an unfinished sentence. Meanwhile the monumental \"4\" of the painting itself is almost lost among the lively brushstrokes.",
