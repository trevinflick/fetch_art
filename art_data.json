    "description": "Arthur Dove often listened to popular music while he worked. Here, he translated the fast syncopation, joyous rhythms, and improvisational elements of Louis Armstrong\u2019s swing music into an abstract painted composition. Patches of red erupt across the canvas, leaping out of darker areas as if to suggest the blare of a horn across a nightclub.",
