    "description": "Constantin Br\u00e2ncusi was long influenced by African art in his choice of materials and forms, but it was not until the middle of his career that he chose to represent an African subject. According to him, the impetus was a visit to the 1922 Colonial Exposition, where he observed a woman he understood to be of African descent. Here the anonymous subject, rendered with just lips and hair, reflects European stereotypes about African physiognomy.",
