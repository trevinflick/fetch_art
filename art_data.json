    "description": "This painting of a half-naked boy holding a basket of grapes has been interpreted as the infant Bacchus, the god of wine, although Piazzetta, one of Vencie's leading painters, made no reference in his description. The artist was probably responding to his patron\u2019s taste for pastoral scenes, a genre that appealed to middle- and upper-class city dwellers for its idealized views of rural life.",
