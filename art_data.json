    "description": "This type of female torso\u2014which depicts Venus (Aphrodite to the Greeks) wearing a sheer, revealing garment\u2014was frequently used in the Roman world to represent the goddess in her role as mother (or genetrix in Latin). The statue type, which was likely based on an earlier Greek bronze statue of Aphrodite, was also used in portraits of Roman empresses, who, in producing future emperors, likened themselves to Venus as mothers of the imperial line.",
