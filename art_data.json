    "description": "In the spirit of modernist challenges to authority and convention, Joan Mir\u00f3 declared in 1927 his intent to \u201cassassinate painting\u201d and upend its traditional hierarchies of materials and subject matter. Painting demonstrates Mir\u00f3\u2019s ongoing search for new artistic materials, including gravel and sand mixed into oil paint, which he applied to Masonite, a rugged support he favored over traditional canvas.",
