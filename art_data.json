    "description": "Paul Delvaux painted this monumental work after adopting Surrealism to give form to his inner world of fantasy and memories. Here, he transformed an episode from Jules Verne\u2019s <em>Journey to the Center of the Earth</em> (1864) in which the professor and his nephew discover a prehistoric forest deep inside the earth. (The nephew, at the very left edge, bears a striking resemblance to the artist.)",
