    "description": "While Henri Matisse is perhaps best known as a painter, his work in other media\u2014drawing, printmaking, and especially sculpture\u2014was rooted in his earliest artistic experiences and training. His three-dimensional pieces reveal an interest in the human figure\u2014the female nude, in particular\u2014as well as ancient and Old Master works of art. With its sharply faceted limbs and monumental scale, <em>Seated Nude</em> suggests both vitality and repose.",
