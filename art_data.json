    "description": "The Chokwe use masquerades to engage with their ancestors, encouraging them to guide, protect, and educate the living. The <em>chihongo</em> is the male counterpart to the female <em>mwana pwo</em> mask. Its feathered headdress, red coloring, scarification patterns, stylized beard, and filed teeth are all markers of wisdom, leadership, and status.",
