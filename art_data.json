    "description": "John Constable produced this full-size oil sketch for an unrealized painting near the end of his life. Its subject\u2014the countryside of Constable's youth in Suffolk, England\u2014was one of the artist's favorites. To achieve the effect of sparkling wetness and fresh earth and air, Constable painted with a palette knife, flecking the surface with white highlights as he sketched and scraped the picture into existence.",
