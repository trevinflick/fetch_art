    "description": "Although Johnson is best known for figural works, these teacups are an example of his approach to making functional objects while broadening his subject matter and materials. He was perennially interested in exploring black identity. Here, he used contrasting semicircles and rectangles to shape the handles of the cups and carried this focus on geometric form into abstract patterns, silhouetted figures, and musical instruments.",
