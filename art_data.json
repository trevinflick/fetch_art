    "description": "This large, milky white jar, made during Korea\u2019s Joseon dynasty (1392\u20131910), is called a moon jar because of its distinctive shape and color. This example, like many moon jars, has mysterious spots\u2014possibly from liquid it once contained or from crystal growth from the slow cooling of the kiln. Either way, these stains have become a part of the identity of Joseon moon jars.",
