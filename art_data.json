    "description": "X-radiographs have revealed that this painting is a fragment of <em>Les Gitanes</em>, a large portrait of a gypsy family exhibited by Manet in 1863 and 1867. Apparently dissatisfied with his complex imitation of Spanish Baroque art, he cut the original painting into three sections and reconceived this portion as an individual work of art. Manet renamed it <em>La R\u00e9galade</em>, which means to pour liquid from a bottle down the throat without touching the lips.",
