    "description": "John Singleton Copley garnered considerable success as a portrait painter before the Revolutionary War. The sitter here, Mary Greene Hubbard, was a member of Boston\u2019s merchant class. Her pose, gown, and background were precisely copied from a British engraving of a noblewoman, yet Copley distinguished the work as his own by capturing Hubbard\u2019s unique features and the luxurious fabrics she wears.",
