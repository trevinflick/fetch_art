    "description": "After living in Paris in the 1950s, Sam Francis became influenced by the work of the Impressionists and their early 20th-century successors. After viewing Monet\u2019s <em>Nympheas at L\u2019Orangerie</em> in 1953, Francis transformed his palette from pale grays and muted hues to an explosive mixture of primary colors. Dynamically combining cadmium red and deep blue, <em>Red No. 2</em> exemplifies the vibrancy of Francis\u2019s paintings from this era.",
