    "description": "This delicate rendering of a mother holding her newborn child celebrates human fertility. Scarification patterns, hairstyles, jewelry, and anatomical details express the Luluwa concept of <em>bwimpe</em>, which unites beauty with goodness. Such figures may have served as both containers for medicine and symbols of status, reflecting societal changes in the latter half of the 19th century.",
