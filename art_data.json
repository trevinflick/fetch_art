    "description": "Matisse worked on this painting for years, increasingly restricting the palette and abstracting the forms. His faceless figures are composed of simplified shapes; one steps into a thick, black band that seems to represent the river, while a white, snakelike form slithers near another bather\u2019s feet. The artist considered this painting one of his most pivotal in the evolution of his mature style.",
