    "description": "This canvas, exhibited at the Salon of 1873, relates to Fantin-Latour\u2019s largest and most famous painting of the decade, <em>The Corner of a Table</em>, an immense composition that includes detailed portraits of several major young Parisian poets and writers. The table around which they are posed displays many of the still-life elements that are arranged in a natural, random fashion in this work.",
