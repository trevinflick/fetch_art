    "description": "An Austrian-born architect and furniture designer, Neutra embraced American industrial materials and technologies in his lightfilled buildings and furnishings like this chair. After training briefly with Frank Lloyd Wright in 1924, Neutra developed a clean aesthetic devoid of applied ornament that was conscious of function and comfort. Here, the curved spring bending from the back to the base allows the chair to adjust to different bodies.",
