    "description": "Toulouse-Lautrec made a career depicting colorful personalities from Parisian cabarets and dance halls like the Moulin Rouge. He populated this painting with that nightclub's regulars, including himself\u2014the diminutive figure in the center background. Dancer La Goulue arranges her hair behind the table where Jane Avril, another performer, socializes. Singer May Milton peers out from the painting's right edge, her face harshly lit and acid green.",
