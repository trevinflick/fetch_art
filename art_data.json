    "description": "Auguste Rodin's figure of Adam was originally intended to be paired with a sculpture of Eve to flank his monumental bronze portal, <em>The Gates of Hell</em>, for the Mus\u00e9e de Arts D\u00e9coratifs, Paris. Rodin created over 200 of its figures and groupings, exploring the expressive potential of the human body. However, the museum building was never constructed and the portal never completed as originally conceived.",
