    "description": "Many scholars suggest that this distinctive Tang form may have been inspired by earlier Hellenistic ceramic and glass vessels, such as the Greek amphora.

They created a high-shouldered silhouette with a slender neck gracefully framed by curved handles, whose dragon heads bite the cupped mouth-rim in their open jaws.",
