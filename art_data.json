    "description": "The Franciscans were among the reformed religious orders whose preaching and teaching activities helped revive the Roman Catholic Church in the Southern Netherlands following years of turmoil in the 1500s. Rubens here depicted the order\u2019s founder, Saint Francis of Assisi, recognizable by the wound that imitates the pierced hands of the crucified Jesus. Rubens conveyed the saint\u2019s spirituality through his meditative gaze and posture.",
