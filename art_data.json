    "description": "Technological improvements to optical scientific instruments in the mid-19th century spurred a craze across Europe with identifying and classifying the natural world. Amateur botanists were eager to collect and preserve floral specimens, which they intently researched and catalogued. In response to this broad appeal, French glassmakers made paperweights that portrayed highly sought-after botanical subjects.",
