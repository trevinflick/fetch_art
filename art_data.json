    "description": "Throughout his career, pioneering artist Jasper Johns repeatedly explored various symbols, including numbers, the American flag, and the alphabet. The target was among the earliest of these recurring motifs: from 1955 to 1961 he produced several dozen paintings and drawings, including this work, that used the symbol as a means of exploring the color and character of his mark making in various mediums.",
