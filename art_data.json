    "description": "While early Roman coins depicted gods and goddesses on the front side, this changed after Caesar\u2019s portrait appeared on a coin in 44 BCE. Thereafter, profile portraits of current rulers and imperial family members became the standard. This coin featuring Hadrian was produced similarly to how coins are produced today; the images were engraved into bronze dies and then struck, one by one, in metal.",
