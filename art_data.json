    "description": "This cameo showing an idealized portrait of Emperor Claudius was created for use in his imperial court. It combines Claudius's image with that of the supreme diety Jupiter. Here, the emperor holds the god\u2019s scepter and thunderbolt, while an eagle stands at his feet, boldly equating Claudius\u2019s power over the Roman Empire to that of Jupiter over the entire cosmos.",
