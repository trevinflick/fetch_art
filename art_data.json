    "description": "While institutionalized in Saint-R\u00e9my, Van Gogh often copied works by artists he admired, which freed him from having to produce original compositions and allowed him to concentrate on interpretation. In his vibrant take on Honor\u00e9 Daumier\u2019s woodcarving \"Physiology of Drinking,\" there is real pathos and a desperation in the earnest concentration with which the men drink, as if to quench a spiritual thirst.",
