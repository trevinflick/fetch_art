    "description": "This painting is set in the town of Arcueil, south of Paris, where Feininger spent several months a year from 1906 to 1912. Feininger's intense interest in architecture is apparent not only in the use of the town's majestic viaduct but also in the brilliantly colored houses. Against this dramatic backdrop, Feininger depicted a motley crew of characters, some of whom recall Feininger's earlier cartoons.",
