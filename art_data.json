    "description": "In the 1920s Georgia O\u2019Keeffe began creating the paintings of enlarged flowers for which she is most famous, including a series of works devoted to the white rose. This painting is her most abstracted depiction of the subject. She simplified the energy of the blooming rose to its essence so that it resembles a brilliant light radiating out of flat cubist planes.",
