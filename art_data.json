    "description": "In the 1960s Roy Lichtenstein began replicating by hand the dots and hatch marks used to print romance comics and advertising illustrations. Two decades later he used his signature mode to mimic the style and subjects of Abstract Expressionist painter Willem de Kooning, injecting both humor and a Pop Art chill into his renditions. Here, his fierce figure is denoted by eyes, an elfin ear, bared teeth, and red dots that stand in for a rouged cheek.",
