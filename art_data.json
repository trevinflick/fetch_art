    "description": "In the 1510s, Sebastiano del Piombo traveled to Rome, where he was drawn into the lively competition between the period's two great luminaries, Michelangelo and Raphael. Michelangelo took Sebastiano under his wing, teaching him his monumental style and providing drawings for commissions. This painting represents a popular composition by Piombo, who became one of the most distinguished painters working during the High Renaissance.",
