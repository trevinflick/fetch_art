    "description": "Monet created this painting in 1884 when he traveled to Bordighera, a town on the Italian Riviera. In a letter to sculptor Auguste Rodin, he described his efforts to capture the brilliant Mediterranean light, declaring that he was \u201cfencing, wrestling, with the sun.\u201d In this light-drenched composition painted from a hilltop vantage point, the sea is barely visible through the interlaced trunks of pine trees.",
