    "description": "In this work, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe painted the small building that housed the darkroom of her husband, Alfred Stieglitz, in Lake George, New York. The couple often took on the same subjects, and Stieglitz photographed this building the same year on a snowy day. O'Keeffe selected a springtime view, employing lush pastel colors for the flowering trees and simplifying the architecture to omit the house\u2019s chimney, window, and horizontal siding.",
