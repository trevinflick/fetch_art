    "description": "In this early painting by Hale Woodruff, the artist expressively rendered evening's changing light with bold and thick streaks of pigment. Paintings like Twilight inspired Harlem Renaissance author Alain Locke to proclaim, \u201cMr. Woodruff paints landscapes of originality\u201d with a \u201cwarm beauty\u201d of color. The artist went on to become an influential muralist and educator who promoted the works and careers of African American artists.",
