    "description": "Dal\u00ed claimed this portrait was obtained using his \"paranoiac-critical\" method, which he thought of as a \"spontaneous method of irrational knowledge.\" He once compared himself to a medium, able to \"see\" images \"that would spring up in my imagination.\" Images of eyes is ubiquitous in Surrealist art, where it usually stands paradoxically for the idea of internal rather than external vision. The Surrealists regarded Lautr\u00e9mont as a great visionary.",
