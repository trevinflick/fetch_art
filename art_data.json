    "description": "Joseph Cornell\u2019s early works that transitioned from collage to three-dimensional assemblages were often, as here, accompanied by a theatrical element. \u201cShadow Boxes,\u201d as Cornell called some of his constructions of this period, resemble toy shadow-box theaters that were popular in the United States in the latter part of the 19th century. The articulated marionette can be set in motion by manipulating the strings at the top of the box.",
