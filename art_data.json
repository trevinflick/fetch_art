    "description": "Jean Hey, known as the Master of Moulins, was a leading painter in 15th-century France. Here, he captured the moment the archangel Gabriel announced to Mary that she would give birth to a son. The painting once formed the right side of an altarpiece, with the left side depicting Mary\u2019s own Immaculate Conception and a central section, now lost, featuring the enthroned Virgin and Child.",
