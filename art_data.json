    "description": "O\u2019Keeffe traveled to the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula in Quebec, Canada, in the summer of 1932. The old barns and crosses built by the region\u2019s French settlers fascinated her, as did the lush green terrain. In this panoramic landscape, she captured this greenery as well as the massive appearance of the mountains as they rise sharply from the water\u2019s edge.",
