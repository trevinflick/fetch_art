    "description": "Noguchi first designed this sculptural chess table for the 1944 Surrealist exhibition <em>The Imagery of Chess</em>. He drew from the gestural profiles of Chinese calligraphy for the tabletop form and Japanese joinery techniques for the base\u2019s interlocking legs. The designer George Nelson bought the original table and a few years later connected Noguchi with the manufacturer Herman Miller, who briefly put the table into commercial production.",
