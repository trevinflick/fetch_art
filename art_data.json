    "description": "<em>Miscegenated Family Album</em> is a series of diptychs, each containing an image of the ancient Egyptian queen Nefertiti paired with an image of the artist\u2019s deceased sister, Devonia Evangeline O\u2019Grady Allen, or with members of their respective families. Both reflect the consequences of generations of cross-cultural exchange and interracial marriage. The physical resemblances between the individuals, as in this diptych, are sometimes startling.",
