    "description": "Claude Monet and his family lived in Argenteuil, outside Paris, from 1871 to 1878. In this painting, he depicted his five- or six-year-old son, Jean, playing with a hoop, and his wife, Camille, standing in the doorway of their vine-covered house. The pleasant weather and neatly kept garden, a forerunner of the artist\u2019s celebrated garden at Giverny, give a sense of tranquility and well-being.",
