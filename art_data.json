    "description": "Naymlap, the heroic founder-colonizer of the Lambayque Valley on the north coast of Peru, is thought to be the legendary figure represented on the top of this striking gold <em>tumi</em> (ceremonial knife). It would have been carried by a dynastic ruler during state ceremonies to represent, in a more precious form, the copper knives used for animal sacrifices.",
