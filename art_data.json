    "description": "This helmet was part of the armor worn in the joust, a sporting combat fought between pairs of mounted contestants. The visor was a movable plate attached to the helmet to protect the face, while the bevor was used to shield the chin and upper throat. Although designed primarily for protection, the pieces are decorated with etched and gilt motifs of figures and foliate strapwork.",
