    "description": "Since the early 1980s, Marlene Dumas, a white woman raised under apartheid in South Africa, has created figurative paintings and ink-wash drawings that raise provocative questions about gender, beauty, sexuality, race, and the effects of oppression and violence. This representation of a black African albino man destabilizes the division between black and white, exposing race as a social construct that fails to correspond to identity.",
