    "description": "This statue depicts the legendary Greek hunter Meleager, who earned his fame by killing a ferocious boar that terrorized the people of Calydon. About 40 Roman sculptural representations of Meleager survive today, leading scholars to conclude that they were based on an earlier Greek statue, possibly by the architect and sculptor Skopas of Paros, who incorporated a marble relief depicting the Calydonian boar hunt on one of his buildings.",
