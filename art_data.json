    "description": "Native artists such as Kelly Church, a fifth-generation basketmaker, have long used black ash trees to create their woven vessels. But these trees are being decimated by the emerald ash borer, an invasive insect. Church worries that knowledge keepers may not be able to teach this art to the next generation. Inside this basket, she has placed a flash drive containing files that record this knowledge so that our museum can help preserve it.",
