    "description": "In the spring of 1948, Ren\u00e9 Magritte debuted an astonishing body of work, including this painting, in which he set out to challenge the notion of artistic sincerity. Radiantly expressive and looking nothing like his paintings of the previous two decades, this new style used lurid colors and crude paint handling to convey the ongoing unease of Europe after the Second World War.",
