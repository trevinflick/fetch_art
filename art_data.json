    "description": "Roman artists adapted Greek imagery for new functions and contexts. Originally, this image of a wounded Greek warrior decorated the shield of the monumental gold-and-ivory statue of the goddess Athena in the Parthenon. Roughly five to six centuries later, the same figure was adapted from its original religious setting for use on this Roman architectural relief, likely for a public building or a lavish home.",
