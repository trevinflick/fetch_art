    "description": "Beauford Delaney offered a penetrating, uncompromising view of himself in this self-portrait. The artist used bold, thick strokes of paint in bright colors to render a portrayal of vibrant yet haunting intensity. The portrait, which seemingly capturing his psyche as well as his appearance, could allude to his struggle for personal and public acceptance as a gay black man.",
