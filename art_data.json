    "description": "Shiraga Kazuo was one of the most widely known artists associated with the Gutai Art Association, a group of artists who advocated for an exuberant, ethically invested freedom of expression. Shiraga sought an unmediated form of painting, soon abandoning the traditional brush to paint with his feet, swinging himself from ropes over sheets of paper or canvas placed on the floor.",
