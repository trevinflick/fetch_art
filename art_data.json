    "description": "Albert Bierstadt is best remembered for his paintings of the American West, but during his early career, the ambitious artist also created New England landscapes, particularly of the White Mountains, as seen here. When this painting was first exhibited in 1863, critics declared it Bierstadt\u2019s \u201cbest work\u201d and praised the artist\u2019s skillful contrast of \u201clight and shade,\u201d which brings a heightened realism to the image.",
