    "description": "Kelly Church, an Ottawa/Pottawatomi/Ojibwe artist, is a fifth-generation basket weaver who teaches Native young people nature conservation, harvesting, and weaving skills learned from her forbearers. Church envisions a future in which traditional knowledge keepers like herself may be unable to teach this art to the next generation. Inside this basket, she has placed a flash drive containing files that record this knowledge for her community.",
