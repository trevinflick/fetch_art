    "description": "This sculpture, which doubles as an inkwell, was created by Sarah Bernhardt, a French actor and artist and perhaps the first global superstar. Here, Bernhardt portrayed herself as a chimera, a mythological creature composed of disparate animals. Bernhardt joined her torso and head to clawed haunches, bat wings, and a dragon-like tail, fashioning a distinct public image for herself through her artwork.",
