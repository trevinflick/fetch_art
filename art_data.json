    "description": "Constantin Brancusi rendered his human and animal forms as highly abstracted, almost geometric shapes. Here, he refers to a Greek myth in which the god Zeus transformed into a swan to seduce the beautiful Leda, but Brancusi confessed he \"never could imagine a male being turned into a swan\" and reversed the transformation in his sculpture. His swan, Leda, glows in streamlined, white stone.",
