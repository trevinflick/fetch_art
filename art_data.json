    "description": "In summer 1901 Monet rented a house in Lavacourt across the Seine from V\u00e9theuil. He began 15 paintings of V\u00e9theuil from the balcony of the same restricted view, documenting the changes in light throughout the day. Rather than replicating the area\u2019s topography, he emphasized the decorative over the descriptive qualities of this riverscape. His loose brushwork and subtle color transitions dissolve the borders between the water, land, and sky.",
