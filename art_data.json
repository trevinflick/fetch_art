    "description": "Peter Blume often spent years on a single painting; this work took four years to complete. As is often the case with Blume's work, the complex imagery\u2014a shattered red rock resting on top of a base that is being demolished by the workers below\u2014resists easy interpretation. It may point to devastation and reconstruction, reflecting the turbulence of World War II and its aftermath.",
