    "description": "Peruvian artist Celia Vasquez-Yui built this large sculpture of a jaguar (<em>otorongo</em> in Quechua) from coiled clay and covered it in finely incised and painted patterns called <em>ken\u00e9</em>. In Shipibo-Conibo culture, women create ken\u00e9, which they may paint or embroider on objects as well as draw on the skin. The labyrinthine patterns are subsequently used by male shamans in healing rituals.",
