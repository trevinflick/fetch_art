    "description": "Through 1890 and 1891, Monet created a series of paintings depicting the stacks of wheat that stood outside his farmhouse in Giverny. He worked both in the field, painting simultaneously at several easels, and in the studio, refining pictorial harmonies. In this view, and in nearly all of the autumn views, the conical tops of the stacks break the horizon and push into the sky.",
