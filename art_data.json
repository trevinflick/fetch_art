    "description": "This head probably comes from a full-length sculpture of one of the apostles flanking the portals of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. With its references to ancient and Byzantine models, it bears all the stylistic hallmarks of the beginning of the Gothic style. Medieval sculpture like this was purposely damaged in the 1790s during the French Revolution because of its presumed royal associations.",
