    "description": "Bazille was in his mid-20s when he executed this startlingly direct self-portrait. He created this work while sharing an apartment-studio with Claude Monet and experimenting with new painting techniques that would be central to the Impressionist movement. It was both a practice piece and, given his recent decision to abandon a medical career in favor of art, a professional manifesto.",
